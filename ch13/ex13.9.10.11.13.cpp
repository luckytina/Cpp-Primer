//!
//! Exercise 13.9:
//! What is a destructor? What does the synthesized destructor do? When is a destructor synthesized?
//  The destructor is a member function with the name of the class prefixed by a tilde (~).
//  It has no return value and takes no parameters:
class Foo
{
public:
    ~Foo();    // destructor
};
//
//  As with the copy constructor and the copy-assignment operator, for some classes,
//  the synthesized destructor is defined to disallow objects of the type from being
//  destroyed (ยง 13.1.6, p. 508). Otherwise, the synthesized destructor has an empty
//  function body.
//
//  When no user-defined destructor, the compiler will define a synthesized version.
//!
//! Exercise 13.10:
//! What happens when a StrBlob object is destroyed? What about a StrBlobPtr?
//! When a StrBlobPter object is destroyed the object dynamicaly allocated will not be
//! freed.
//! When a StrBlob object destroyed, the use count of the dynamic object will decrement.
//! It wiil be freed if no shared_ptr to that dynamic object.
//!
//! Exercise 13.11:
//! Add a destructor to your HasPtr class from the previous exercises.
//!
//! Exercise 13.13:
//! A good way to understand copy-control members and constructors is to define a simple
//! class with these members in which each member prints its name:
//!
//! Add the copy-assignment operator and destructor to X
//! and write a program using X
//! objects in various ways: Pass them as nonreference and reference parameters; dynamically
//! allocate them; put them in containers; and so forth. Study the output until you are
//! certain you understand when and why each copy-control member is used. As you read the output,
//! remember that the compiler can omit calls to the copy constructor.
