//! Exercise 7.23:
//! Write your own version of the Screen class.
//!
//! Exercise 7.24:
//! Give your Screen class three constructors:
//! a default constructor;
//! a constructor that takes values for height and width and initializes the contents
//! to hold the given number of blanks;
//! and a constructor that takes values for height, width, and a character to use as
//! the contents of the screen.
//!
//!
//!
//! Exercise 7.25:
//! Can Screen safely rely on the default versions of copy and assignment?
//! If so, why? If not, why not?
//!
//  The class below can rely on it. It goes in Section 7.1.5:"..the synthesized versions
//  are unlikely to work correctly for classes that allocate resources that reside outside
//  the class objects themselves. " and "Moreover, the synthesized versions for copy, assignment,
//  and destruction work correctly for classes that have vector or string members. " Hence
//  the class below which used only built-in type and strings can rely on the default
//  version of copy and assignment.
//!

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class wyScreen
{
public:
    typedef std::string::size_type pos;

    //!  constructs:
    wyScreen() = default;
    wyScreen(const pos h, const pos w, pos n) : height(h), width(w)
    {
        while(n--)  this->contents += " ";
    }
    wyScreen(const pos h, const pos w, const std::string &c) : height(h), width(w){ this->contents += c; }

private:
    pos cursor = 0;
    pos height = 0, width = 0;
