//! Exercise 7.32:
//! Define your own versions of Screen and Window_mgr
//! in which clear is a member of Window_mgr and a friend of Screen.
//  steps:
//  First, define the Window_mgr class, which declares, but cannot
//  define, clear. Screen must be declared before clear can use the
//  members of Screen.
//
//  Next, define class Screen, including a friend declaration for clear.
//
//  Finally, define clear, which can now refer to the members in Screen.
