##Exercise 2.36>In the following code, determine the type of each variableand the value each variable has when the code finishes:```cppint a = 3, b = 4;decltype(a) c = a;decltype((b)) d = a;++c;++d;````c` is an int, `d` is a referance of `a`.all their value are `4`.##Exercise 2.37>Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:```cppint a = 3, b = 4;decltype(a) c = a;decltype(a = b) d = a;````c` is an int, `d` is a reference of int.##Exercise 2.38>Describe the differences in type deduction between decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.The way `decltype` handles top-level const and references differs **subtly** from the way `auto` does.Another important difference between `decltype` and `auto` is that the deduction done by decltype depends on the **form** of its given expression.so the key of difference is **subtly** and **form**.```cppint i = 0, &r = i;// sameauto a = i;decltype(i) b = i;// differentauto c = r;decltype(r) d = i;```More?
