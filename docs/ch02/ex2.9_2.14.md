##Exercise 2.9>Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.- (a) std::cin >> int input_value;- (b) int i = { 3.14 };- (c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;- (d) int i = 3.14;(a): error: expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction.```cppint input_value = 0;std::cin >> input_value;```(b): warning: implicit conversion from 'double' to 'int' changes value from 3.14 to 3.```cppfloat i = { 3.14 };```(c): error: use of undeclared identifier 'wage'```cppdouble salary = 9999.99;double wage = 9999.99;```(d): ok: but value will be truncated.```cppfloat i = 3.14;```##Exercise 2.10>What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?```cppstd::string global_str;int global_int;int main(){  int local_int;  std::string local_str;}````global_str` and `local_str` are the empty string.`global_int` and `local_int` are the zero.##Exercise 2.11> Explain whether each of the following is a declaration or adefinition:- (a) extern int ix = 1024;- (b) int iy;- (c) extern int iz;    (a): definition.    (b): definition.    (c): declaration.##Exercise 2.12>Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?- (a) int double = 3.14;- (b) int _;- (c) int catch-22;- (d) int 1_or_2 = 1;- (e) double Double = 3.14;`a`, `c`, `d` are invalid.##Exercise 2.13>What is the value of j in the following program?```cppint i = 42;int main(){  int i = 100;  int j = i;}````100`. local object named reused hides global reused.##Exercise 2.14>Is the following program legal? If so, what values are printed?```cppint i = 100, sum = 0;for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i)  sum += i;std::cout << i << " " << sum << std::endl;```Yes.It is legal.Printed:`100, 45.`
