##Exercise 2.33>Using the variable definitions from this section, determinewhat happens in each of these assignments:```cppa=42; // set 42 to int a.b=42; // set 42 to int b.c=42; // set 42 to int c.d=42; // ERROR, d is an int *. correct: *d = 42;e=42; // ERROR, e is an const int *. correct: e = &c;g=42; // ERROR, g is a const int& that is bound to ci.```##Exercise 2.34>Write a program containing the variables and assignments from theprevious exercise.Print the variables before and after the assignments to checkwhether your predictions in the previous exercise were correct.If not, study the examples until you can convince yourself you know￼￼what led you to the wrong conclusion.[Here](https://github.com/pezy/Cpp-Primer/blob/master/ch02/ex2_34.cpp) is the code.##Exercise 2.35>Determine the types deduced in each of the following definitions.Once you’ve figured out the types,write a program to see whether you were correct.```cppconst int i = 42;auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i; const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;```j and j2 are int.k and k2 are &int.p is a pointer to const int.[Here](https://github.com/pezy/Cpp-Primer/blob/master/ch02/ex2_35.cpp) is the code.
