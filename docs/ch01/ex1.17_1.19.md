##Exercise 1.17

> What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

If the input values are all equal, it will print nothing unless you enter `EOF`.

If there are no duplicated values, when different values input, a new line will be printed if you click `Enter`.

##Exercise 1.18

> Compile and run the program from this section giving it only equal values as input. Run it again giving it values in which no number is repeated.
