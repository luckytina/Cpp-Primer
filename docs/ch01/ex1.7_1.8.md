##Exercise 1.7

> Compile a program that has incorrectly nested comments.

Example:
```cpp
/*
* comment pairs /* */ cannot nest.
* ''cannot nest'' is considered source code,
* as is the rest of the program
*/
int main()
{
  return 0;
}
```

Compiled result(g++):

##Exercise 1.8

> Indicate which, if any, of the following output statements are legal:
```cpp
std::cout << "/*";
std::cout << "*/";
std::cout << /* "*/" */;
std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;
```
> After youâ€™ve predicted what will happen, test your answers by compiling a
program with each of these statements. Correct any errors you encounter.

Compiled result(g++):

![result](https://db.tt/mrL9hDCS)

Corrected? just added a quote:
```cpp
std::cout << "/*";
std::cout << "*/";
std::cout << /* "*/" */";
std::cout << /* "*/" /* "/*" */;
```

Output:

    /**/ */ /*
