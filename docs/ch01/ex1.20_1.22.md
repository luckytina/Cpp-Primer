##Exercise 1.20

> http://www.informit.com/title/032174113 contains a copy of Sales_item.h in the Chapter 1 code directory. Copy that file to your working directory. Use it to write a program that reads a set of book sales transactions, writing each transaction to the standard output.

[Here](https://github.com/pezy/Cpp-Primer/blob/master/ch01/ex1_20.cpp) is the code.

**You need to enable C++11 support in your compiler.
With GCC and Clang, this can be done with the `-std=c++11` option.**

**(Never say it again.)**

How to test it? use the `book.txt` in `data` folder. And do it like this:

##Exercise 1.21
> Write a program that reads two Sales_item objects that have the same ISBN and produces their sum.

The program should check whether the objects have the same ISBN.(Have a look at 1.5.2, surprise!)

##Exercise 1.22

> Write a program that reads several transactions for the same ISBN. Write the sum of all the transactions that were read.

Tips: this program will appear in the section 1.6.

[Here](https://github.com/pezy/Cpp-Primer/blob/master/ch01/ex1_22.cpp) is the code.
