//!
//! Exercise 12.19:
//! Define your own version of StrBlobPtr and update your StrBlob class with
//! the appropriate friend declaration and begin and end members.
//  Discussion on Stack Overflow:
//  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20768083/using-qt-creator-why-cant-my-class-header-compile
//!
//! Exercise 12.20:
//! Write a program that reads an input file a line at a time into a StrBlob
//! and uses a StrBlobPtr to print each element in that StrBlob.
//!
//! Exercise 12.21:
//! We could have written StrBlobPtrâ€™s deref member as follows:
//!      std::string& deref() const
//!      { return (*check(curr, "dereference past end"))[curr]; }
//! Which version do you think is better and why?
//  This version has worse readibility.Thus the original one is better
//!
//! Exercise 12.22:
//! What changes would need to be made to StrBlobPtr to create a class that can
//! be used with a const StrBlob? Define a class named ConstStrBlobPtr that can
//! point to a const StrBlob.
//!
